# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains an implementation of a **machine learning pipeline** for analyzing and predicting diabetes-related outcomes using patient data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and performs data cleaning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generates insights and visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements classification models for predicting diabetes outcomes.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Uses permutation importance to analyze key factors.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

## Dataset
- The project uses diabetic_data.csv, which contains medical records related to diabetes.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (final.ipynb).
- The notebook will perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- View classification metrics and feature importance.
